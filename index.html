        <h2>Section 1</h2>
        <p>Although gold had been rumoured to have been found in Australia as early as 1814, 
            the first gold fields did not appear until forty years later. Gold discoveries were
            not considered blessings in the pre-1850’s Australian convict society, as the authorities 
            believed gold fever could potentially cause anarchy in the small fledgling British colonies. 
            Most finds were kept very quiet, as most finders soon found themselves accused of theft and punished 
            violently for their trouble. Because the society was predominantly criminals and convicts, this story 
            was easier to believe than the idea that these people were just picking it up in the bush. However, many 
            of these people were hushed up and punished for another reason. Farmers, wealthy landowners and the 
            authorities were afraid that if word got around that gold had been found, then many of their lowly paid 
            workers and labourers would leave their jobs. This all ended when the California gold rush began to really 
            heat up. Workers from all over the world migrated to the United States to strike it rich. Australia was no 
            exception and when this labour drain began to impact the local economy, Australia’s governors began to 
            look at gold differently.

        <h2>Section 2</h2>
        <p>Gold in Australia was first ‘officially’ discovered in1851 by one Edward Hargraves. Hargraves had just returned 
            empty-handed from the already under-way Californian Gold Rush and had a theory that the Australian and Californian 
            terrains had various similarities. Hargraves travelled West of  Sydney towards the Bathurst Plains and it was here 
            that the first publicized gold was found. This area would become Australia’s earliest goldfield. The government officially 
            declared the gold discovery on the 22nd of  May 1851 and thousands flocked to the Bathurst plains.
        </p>    
        <p>The first gold rush was well and truly on in New South Wales, but far more was yet to come. The Victorian Authorities in 
            Melbourne grew anxious, as many of their population made their way north towards Bathurst to try their luck. As labour 
            started to become scarcer, Governor La Trobe offered a £200 reward for any gold found within a 200 mile radius of Melbourne 
            in an attempt to attract people to Melbourne. Soon after, gold was found at Warrandyte, now a suburb of Melbourne. This started 
            an early mini gold rush. But these finds were not large enough to spark a state-wide gold frenzy. Rich gold fields were on the 
            horizon, however. Ones that would change the new colony of Victoria forever.

        <h2>Section 3</h2>
        <p>These gigantic finds were at what is now recognised as part of the State of Victoria’s Golden  Triangle. A blacksmith discovered 
            gold a few kilometres north of Ballarat, a small farming village west of Melbourne. This was to be one of the richest gold fields 
            the world has ever seen. 10,000 miners arrived in less than a year and turned this once sleepy region into Victoria’s largest 
            settlement. Miners and prospectors who were originally heading to Bathurst now turned towards Ballarat instead.
        </p>
        <p>The massive influx of immigrants was more than the fledgling colonies of New South Wales and Victoria could handle. 
            Room soon became scarce, as lodging houses and hotels were quickly filled. Faced with the ongoing wave of immigrants arriving 
            in ships almost daily, new measures had to be taken to provide some kind of accommodation for the new arrivals. `Canvas towns’ 
            began to spring up in the south of Melbourne. New arrivals to Victoria were given a rough canvas tent and these were set up in rows, 
            forming `streets’. The occupants of the canvas towns named the streets that were formed, mostly after prestigious English streets 
            such as Bond Street, Regent Street and so on. The existence of these small canvas settlements was legalized by Governor LaTrobe in 
            1852, when he imposed a weekly rent of five shillings per tent.

          <h2>Section 4</h2>
          <p>From a fledgling penal settlement, the gold rush and ensuing waves of immigration changed the face of the nation. Before 1851, 
              Australia’s combined immigrant population was approximately 77,000. Most of those had been convicts sent by ship over the previous 
              seventy years. The gold rush completely changed that. It suddenly seemed like a foolish idea, and indeed no longer a punishment, 
              to give a free boat ride to Australia’s rich gold fields to anyone who had committed a crime. The arrival of skilled workers and 
              tradesmen provided a boost to the economy as new facilities were made available. The colonies witnessed widespread progress in many 
              areas of industry, particularly in manufacturing, as factories were gradually established and opened.
          </p>
          <p>The presence of so many migrants from different countries created tensions between different groups. Policies were established to 
              limit the number of non-English-speaking migrants from entering Australia. These policies had their roots in the convict era, when 
              the divisions between free men and newly emancipated convicts were sharply drawn. This social division developed into a cultural 
              divide when migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds arrived in Australia. These cultural conflicts persisted for many years, 
              and were the cause of longstanding tensions between different groups. The government’s immigration policies formed during the time 
              of the gold rushes were rigorously enforced and persisted until not long ago.

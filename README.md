## Project Objective
This project required me to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Building 
To build I followed the following steps:

- setting up the environment
- building out my HTML with at least three content sections
- building the navigation menu
- adding functionality to distinguish the section in view
- adding functionality to scroll to sections
- refactoring and testing the performance

## Languages I used: 
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
